# Predictive Emission Reduction Analytics

## Introduction
The **Predictive Emission Reduction Analytics** project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to forecast potential reductions in carbon emissions. This tool is designed to empower policymakers, sustainability professionals, and researchers with actionable insights for achieving decarbonization goals.

The project includes hyperparameter-tuned models, explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP, and visual tools for understanding the relationship between input factors and predicted emission reductions.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Model Training**:
  - Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**:
  - SHAP analysis to interpret model predictions.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
  - Metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).
- **Data Validation**:
  - Ensures data integrity with checks for missing values and outliers.
- **Actionable Visualizations**:
  - Generates plots for feature importance, SHAP explanations, and actual vs. predicted values.
- **Reproducibility**:
  - Ensures consistent results with a fixed random seed.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- scikit-learn
- SHAP
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- joblib

### Installation

Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:
   - Ensure your dataset includes the target column `emission_reduction` and relevant features.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python main_script.py
   ```

3. **Outputs**:
   - The script generates the following:
     - A trained model saved as `emission_reduction_model.pkl`.
     - Visualizations (`shap_summary.png`, `actual_vs_predicted.png`, `feature_importance.png`).

## Example Insights

### Actual vs Predicted Emissions
This plot compares the model’s predictions with the actual emission reductions for evaluation purposes.

### Feature Importance
Identifies the most influential factors in the model’s predictions.

### SHAP Summary
Explains individual contributions of features to model predictions for transparency and trust.
