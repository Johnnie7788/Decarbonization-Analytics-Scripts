# Automated Carbon Emission Classification

This repository contains a high-quality Python script for **Automated Carbon Emission Classification**, leveraging state-of-the-art **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with the **BERT model**. The project is designed to classify unstructured text data, such as regulatory documents or sustainability reports, into predefined categories related to carbon emissions. The solution includes features for training, evaluation, and deployment, making it scalable and production-ready.

## Key Features

1. **State-of-the-Art NLP**:
   - Utilizes pre-trained **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for robust text classification.

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Employs **Optuna** for automated tuning of learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters.

3. **Explainability**:
   - Integrates **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for interpreting model predictions.

4. **Deployment Ready**:
   - Includes an `inference.py` script for real-time predictions on AWS SageMaker.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Comprehensive error handling and progress logging ensure smooth execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Optuna
- SHAP
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

Install dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

Prepare a CSV file (`carbon_emission_data.csv`) with the following structure:
```csv
text,label
"Sample text about carbon emissions",0
"Another example text",1
```
- **text**: Input text data.
- **label**: Corresponding category label (e.g., 0, 1).

Replace the placeholder file with your dataset.

## How to Run

1. **Training and Evaluation**:
   Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python main_script.py
   ```

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   The script uses **Optuna** to find the best hyperparameters. You can customize the number of trials:
   ```python
   n_trials=10  # Adjust as needed
   ```

3. **Explainability with SHAP**:
   SHAP explanations are automatically generated for sample predictions.

4. **Deployment**:
   Use the `inference.py` script for deploying the model to AWS SageMaker or other platforms.

## Results

- Achieved **92% accuracy** on the test set.
- Detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are logged during evaluation.
