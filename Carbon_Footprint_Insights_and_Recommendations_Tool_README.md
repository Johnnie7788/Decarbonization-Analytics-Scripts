# Carbon Footprint Insights and Recommendations Tool

## Overview
The **Carbon Footprint Insights and Recommendations Tool** is a Python-based application designed to analyze emissions data, identify patterns, and generate actionable recommendations for reducing carbon footprints. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques, clustering, and data visualization to support organizations in their sustainability goals.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Validation**: Automatically handles missing values and validates the dataset for correctness.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation**: Computes total emissions based on activity data and emission factors.
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning for accurate emissions predictions.
- **Clustering for Insights**: Groups activities into clusters to identify high-emission activities using K-Means clustering.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Generates specific suggestions for reducing, monitoring, or maintaining activities based on emission levels.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Creates engaging and informative scatter plots using Plotly for easy interpretation.
- **Results Export**: Saves processed data and recommendations to a CSV file.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Carbon-Footprint-Insights-Tool
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the project directory with the name `emission_data.csv` or update the `input_file` variable in the `main()` function.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python carbon_footprint_tool.py
   ```
3. The tool will process the data, generate insights, create visualizations, and save results to `carbon_footprint_insights.csv`.

## Dataset Requirements
- The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:
  - `Emission_Factor`: Emission factor for the activity.
  - `Activity_Data`: Data representing the level of activity.
  - `Activity` (optional): Description of the activity.

## Output
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions for reducing or maintaining emissions levels.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Insights into high, medium, and low emission activities.
- **CSV File**: Processed data and recommendations are saved for further use.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A scatter plot showing clusters and recommendations.

## Example
Here is an example of the expected output:
- **Recommendations**:
  - Reduce emissions by optimizing activity: Transportation.
  - Monitor activity: Manufacturing, potential for optimization.
  - Maintain activity: Office operations with current emission levels.
