# AI-Powered Carbon Intelligence: Driving Climate Action with ML and NLP

This script implements a Python-based solution combining Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tackle climate challenges. The goal is to provide actionable insights for reducing carbon emissions, analyzing policy sentiment, and identifying emission hotspots.

---

## Features
- **Emission Reduction Prediction**:
  - Predict opportunities for emission reduction using a hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest model.
  - Visualize feature importance to identify key factors driving emissions.
- **Policy Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Analyze public sentiment on climate policies using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.
  - Leverage HuggingFace Transformers for advanced sentiment classification.
- **Emission Hotspot Identification**:
  - Generate and visualize geospatial data to pinpoint emission hotspots.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  ```bash
  pandas
  numpy
  scikit-learn
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  transformers
  ```

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
1. Prepare your datasets:
   - `carbon_emission_data.csv`: For emission reduction predictions.
   - `policy_texts.csv`: For sentiment analysis.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Outputs:
   - **Emission Reduction Prediction**:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for predictions.
     - Feature importance plot.
   - **Policy Sentiment Analysis**:
     - Sentiment classification report.
     - Example sentiment analysis results using HuggingFace Transformers.
   - **Emission Hotspot Identification**:
     - Scatterplot of geospatial emission data.

## Example Dataset Format
### carbon_emission_data.csv
| feature1 | feature2 | emission_reduction |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| 0.45     | 0.32     | 0.12              |
| 0.67     | 0.78     | 0.34              |

### policy_texts.csv
| policy_text                                       | sentiment |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| This policy promotes renewable energy adoption.  | positive  |
| This policy may harm industrial productivity.    | negative  |

---

## Output Examples
1. **Feature Importance Plot**:
   Visualize the top features driving emission reductions.
2. **Classification Report**:
   Evaluate sentiment analysis accuracy.
3. **Hotspot Visualization**:
   Geospatial scatterplot identifying high-emission zones.
